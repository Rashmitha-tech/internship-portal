  <h1>Certificate Verification</h1>
  <p>As part of your internship journey at Micro IT, successful completion of all assigned tasks is crucial to earn your internship certificate.</p>
  <p>Each intern must actively participate in weekly assignments, complete milestone projects, and engage in knowledge-sharing sessions.</p>
  <p>Once your mentors verify that you've completed all required deliverables, your profile is submitted for final review.</p>
  <p>The verification team checks your task status and overall performance consistency before issuing the official certificate.</p>
  <p>Certified interns will receive a digital certificate via email, which can be used in resumes, college credits, and portfolio showcases.</p>
